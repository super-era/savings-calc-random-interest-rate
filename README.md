# Savings calculator (randomly-generated interest rate)

## Purpose
This C# project is part of Lesson 3 (CLG C# course), and aims to use operators, variables, user input, type conversions, booleans and other concepts to build a simple savings calculator, that takes input like initial deposit, months saved for, and savings goal. The interest rate is randomly generated, in order to practice using Random() and Next().

## How to run this project
This project was created using Visual Studio Code with the C# OmniSharp extension. Download the .zip file from github and extract to a suitable folder. Open Program.cs in Visual Studio Code. Use the commands

> dotnet build

> dotnet run

to initialise the project, and follow the prompts to use the calculator.

## Concepts this project uses

- operators (+, *, etc)
- comparative operators (<=, etc)
- Math.Pow()
- new Random()
- Next()
